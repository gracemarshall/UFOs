# UFO Sightings
### Purpose
The UFO Challenge is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters will be added for the city, state, country, and shape. 

### Overview of Project
Using JavaScript and HTML, the code is modify in the index.html file to create more table filters, date filter, and filters for the city, state, country, and shape. Below are the steps to accomplish the project objectives;
- create an empty filters variable to keep track of all the elements that change when a search is entered using app.js file. 
- write code for two functions whose names we’ve provided in the starter code, updateFilters() and filterTable().
- located before the buildTable(tableData) function at the end of the starter code, modify the event listener from this module. 
- write code in Steps 4-5 to update the filters based on user input using the updateFilters() function.
- create a variable that saves the value of the changed element’s property.
- create a variable that saves the attribute of the changed element’s id.
- write an if-else statement that checks if a value was changed by the user. If a value was not entered, then clear the element id from the filters variable.

### Results
The new web-page allows the user to navigate using filter search based date criteria. Once the user enters the date, the table is filtered to display the city, state, country, and shape.

### Summary
A drawback on this web-page will be to minimize the use white spaces between the heading "UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy?" and the search filter. Additional improvement will be to create a feedback opportunity to users which will assist in improving the page.
